\begin{abstract}

\emph{Objective}: To investigate the risk of pre-specified adverse events following live attenuated herpes zoster vaccine (ZVL) in older adults attending primary care providers in Australia.

\emph{Methods}: Individuals aged 70 to 79 years who received ZVL between 1 November 2016 and 31 July 2018 were identified within a nationally representative primary care database. The self-controlled case series (SCCS) method was used to estimate the seasonally-adjusted relative incidence (RI) of seven outcome events (injection site reaction (ISR), burn [negative control], myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, any rash, rash with a prescription for an antiviral within 2 days of the rash-related encounter, and clinical attendance) during a post-vaccination, at-risk window compared with a time distant to vaccination. Sensitivity analyses examined the effect of concomitant vaccination (influenza and 23-valent pneumococcal vaccination) and restriction to first outcome event. 

\emph{Results}: A total of 332,988 vaccination encounters in 150,054 individuals were identified during the study period. The most common outcome identified was clinical attendance (\textgreater 2 million events) followed by rash (12,309 events); ISR was the rarest outcome (177 events). There was an increased RI of ISR in the 7 days following ZVL (RI = 77.4; 95\% CI = [48.1, 124.6]). No change to the RI of MI (0.74; [0.41, 1.33]), rash (0.97; [0.8 to 1.08]), or rash with antiviral (0.83; [0.62 to 1.10]) were identified in the 42 days following ZVL. The RI of clinical attendance (0.94; [0.94, 0.95]) and stroke (0.6; [0.4, 0.8]) were lower in the 42 days following administration of ZVL.

\emph{Conclusions}: No new safety concerns were identified for ZVL in this study based on a novel primary care data source using an SCCS design. An expected increased risk of ISR was identified; findings in relation to cardiovascular disease were reassuring.

\section{Introduction}

Herpes zoster (HZ) is a localised, painful, vesicular skin rash resulting from reactivation of varicella-zoster virus. The average lifetime risk is around 30\% but increases with age \citep{brisson2001epidemiology}. Prior to implementation of vaccination programs, the incidence of HZ in Australia was reported to be 10 per 1000 persons aged 50 years and older \citep{stein2009herpes}, similar to rates observed in Europe \citep{pinchinat2013similar} and the United States (US) \citep{insinga2005incidence}. The risk of post-herpetic neuralgia, a chronic neuropathic pain syndrome common following HZ, also increases with age. Disseminated disease can occur in people who are immunosuppressed. 

Live attenuated varicella-zoster vaccine (ZVL) was registered for use in Australia in 2006 and available from 2014 for people aged over 50 years \citep{yawn2007population}. It is recommended for immunocompetent adults over 60 years of age. In November 2016, a funded ZVL immunisation program commenced under the Australian National Immunisation Program (NIP) for adults aged 70 years, with catch-up for those aged 71–79 years funded until October 2021. 

ZVL was evaluated in large, pre-licensure clinical trials with no increased risk of serious adverse events (SAE), hospitalized adverse events or death \cite{oxman2005, gagliardi2016vaccines, schmader2012}. The rate of injection site reactions (ISR) was higher in vaccine than placebo groups. A post-licensure clinical trial demonstrated a similar safety profile, with no statistically significant difference in the rate of SAE up to 182 days following vaccination \citep{murray2011}. Post-licensure passive surveillance has been consistent with clinical trials. Of 23,556 reports submitted by healthcare providers to the Merck, Sharp, \& Dohme Corp (MSD) Adverse Event (AE) global safety database between May 2006 and May 2016, 93\% of reports were non-serious, with ISR the most commonly reported AE (20.5\%), followed by HZ (8.6\%) and rash (4.2\%) \citep{willis2017herpes}. Of 23,092 reports submitted to the US Vaccine Adverse Events Monitoring System (VAERS) from May 2006 to January 2015, 96\% were classified as non-serious, with ISR, HZ and rash the most frequently reported non-serious AE \citep{miller2018post}.

\hl{In Australia, AusVaxSafety is an active vaccine safety surveillance system that monitors adverse events following immunisation using data reported directly from people receiving the vaccines (or their parent or carer) with responses solicited via an automated SMS or email. Active surveillance of zoster vaccine safety conducted from 1 November 2016 to 4 November 2018 identified no safety signals amongst 18,655 adults aged 70-79 years where 8.3\% of vaccinated individuals reported an adverse event.}\info{http://ausvaxsafety.org.au/safety-data/zoster-vaccine is there any other citation we could use which breaks this down a bit further?}

Post-marketing surveillance methods are limited by the potential for biased reporting and, for ZVL, is confounded by the higher prevalence of chronic disease in the older target population \citep{miller2018post}. The self-controlled case series (SCCS) method was developed for vaccine safety assessment and has the potential to automatically adjust for unmeasured time-invariant confounders by allowing individuals to act as their own control \citep{petersen2016}. SCCS methodology has previously been used to examine ZVL using US data from managed care cohorts \citep{tseng2012} and administrative claims data \citep{minassian2015}. In Australia, older patients typically receive ZVL from their private general practitioner (GP). While practices maintain their own electronic patient records, the Australian Government Department of Health funds NPS MedicineWise to collate GP data through the MedicineInsight program. 

The objective of this study was to use nationally representative GP data from MedicineInsight to examine the risk of pre-specified AE following ZVL in the target NIP cohort.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Study setting}

The MedicineInsight data set consists of longitudinal, de-identified, whole-of-practice data extracted from the clinical information systems (CIS) of participating general practice sites across Australia. These include sites in major cities and in rural and remote areas, similar to the distribution of the Australian population over these areas. The participating sites represent between 15\% and 20\% of the Australian population.  Data is extracted on patient demographics, practice encounters (excluding progress notes), diagnoses, vaccinations, prescriptions, pathology tests and referrals. Practice encounters can include clinical (a medical or nursing appointment) or non-clinical (an entry by administration staff) encounters. Within-site individual identifiers are used to identify records common to an individual attending that site. \improvement{Citation for representativeness of MedicineInsight?

\subsection{Study population}

The target population was individuals aged 70-79 years who were eligible to receive ZVL, 23-valent pneumococcal (23vPPV), or seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine. Although the primary vaccine of interest was ZVL, individuals who had received 23vPPV and seasonal inactivated influenza vaccines were also included for two reasons: ZVL may commonly be co-administered with these two vaccines meaning that any events identified might be attributable to these other vaccines; and to estimate the relative incidence of adverse events in other vaccines using the same data source and methods as a comparator for the ZVL estimates.  All MedicineInsight records were obtained for individuals 70–79 years of age at the date of their vaccination who received ZVL, 23vPPV or influenza vaccine(s) between 1 November 2016 (when the funded ZVL program began) to 31 July 2018. We treated this study population as a random sample of the target population. 

\subsection{Study design}

We undertook a retrospective SCCS analysis of adverse events following ZVL using MedicineInsight data. The SCCS design was developed for vaccine safety evaluation \citep{farrington1995} and has been used in a variety of settings \citep{buttery2011intussusception, bakken2015febrile, stowe2016risk}. The method estimates the relative incidence of an outcome event within a risk window following exposure (i.e. vaccination) compared to the incidence at all other times under observation. Only individuals who have experienced an outcome event contribute to the relative incidence estimate and the design potentially controls for time-invariant confounders.

This study investigated the relative incidence of seven pre-specified outcome events (ISR [positive control], burn [negative control], myocardial infarction, stroke, any rash, rash with a prescription for an antiviral within 2 days of the rash-related encounter, and clinical attendance) in a post-vaccination, at-risk window, with the incidence of these outcome events at times distant from vaccination. ISR was included as a positive control given consistent evidence of an increased risk of ISR in pre-licensure and post-licensure studies. Burn was included as a negative control with any events considered unrelated to vaccination.  

Events for individuals in the study population may not have been observable throughout the entirety of the study period. We defined an individual’s observation period in terms of their historical activity at the site and year of death information. An individual’s start date of observation was defined as the latest of 1 November 2016, or 365 days after their first recorded activity at the site (any encounter, diagnosis, or prescription record). An individual’s end date of observation was defined as 31 December in the year prior to their death for individuals who had year of death recorded, and 31 July 2018 for individuals who had no year of death recorded. The lead time of 365 days from an individual’s start of site activity was specified to allow for a catch up in medical information. The maximum possible observation period for any individual was 638 days.

Exposure (vaccination) was defined as an immunisation record for any of the three vaccines under study with a date of administration occurring within the individual’s observation period. Due to the mix of clinically coded and free text entries, vaccination records for the study vaccines were identified via targeted, free-text search criteria. The date of vaccination was set as the administration date specified in the vaccination record. Individuals with multiple vaccination records for ZVL or 23vPPV during their observation period were excluded as these vaccines are generally recommended to be given as a single dose for older adults. We enforced a minimum time between influenza vaccinations of 126 days because a single dose is generally recommended each season. Any influenza records occurring within 126 days of an individual’s previous influenza vaccintation were excluded from analyses to avoid overlapping risk-windows (\autoref{sec:risk_windows}). Any vaccines with the same recorded date of administration were assumed to be co-administered.

Except for clinical attendance, outcome events were identified using free-text regular expression searches of reason for encounter, reason for diagnosis and reason for prescription fields. Each encounter, diagnosis, or prescription record identified as relating to an outcome event were matched on their respective dates assumed to relate to the one encounter. Records of clinical attendance were identified as any site encounter record excluding those identified to be non-clinical (administrative).  Individuals were identified as cases with respect to an outcome if they experienced at least one event during their observation period.

\subsection{Definition of risk windows}
\label{sec:risk_windows}

At-risk windows were defined consistently for all vaccine types based on biologically plausible windows supported by evidence. For ISR the risk-window was 1–7 days post vaccination, and for all other outcomes was 1–42 days post vaccination. The basis for the length of the risk window for systemic adverse events was the 42 day window used in pre-licensure clinical trials \citep{oxman2005, schmader2012, murray2011, simberkoff2010} and post-licensure studies \citep{tseng2012,baxter2012}. This time period is also biologically plausible for cardiovascular events, which have been observed following wild-type varicella-zoster virus, particularly 1 to 4 weeks following infection \citep{minassian2015,schink2016}, with viral replication in arterial walls the proposed mechanism for cerebrovascular disease \citep{gilden2009}. This risk window is also biologically plausible for rash, with varicella-like rash after 6 weeks more likely to represent wild-type infection \citep{willis2017herpes}. The risk windows for burn (the negative control) and clinical attendance were chosen to be consistent with the risk window for systemic events. For ISR, the risk window was based on the short median time to ISR (\~2 days) in the Shingles Prevention Study (SPS) and post-licensure surveillance \citep{willis2017herpes,simberkoff2010} and the identification of a signal for cellulitis within 7 days in another post-licensure SCCS \citep{tseng2012}.

To account for the potential for an event to affect the likelihood of vaccination a pre-exposure washout period of 42 days pre-vaccination was defined for all outcomes. A 42 day post-risk washout period was also included to minimise the potential for risk that may be attributable to the vaccine to carry over into the control period.  For rash with antiviral, an indefinite post-risk period was specified due to an expected reduced risk following ZVL vaccination. In allowing an indefinite risk period following influenza, overlapping risk periods may be encountered, and therefore for this outcome only the first recorded influenza vaccination was considered for analysis.

Pre-exposure and post-risk washout periods were excluded from the control period. Additionally, the day of vaccination was excluded from analyses. \info{Detail why} This was due to large spikes in encounters for other reasons on the same day as vaccination. All other time an individual was under observation was allocated to the control period.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Statistical methods}

Relative incidence estimates were obtained from an SCCS model \citep{farrington2018} using the windows previously defined. Given that the study period spanned 1 November 2016 to 31 July 2018, we additionally specified fixed windows to adjust for seasonal effects by specifying window cut-points: 1 December, 1 March, 1 June, and 1 September in each year. Each outcome was modelled independently. The main analyses modelled all exposures (vaccines) jointly assuming additive effects in overlapping risk-windows and allowed for recurrent events for each outcome with every outcome event occurring during the observation period contributing towards the relative incidence estimate. Weekly periodicity of events was accounted for indirectly by the specification of risk-windows in terms of full-week cycles.

Dependent of outcome events violates the Poisson assumption of the SCCS model and may bias estimates. Recurrent event dependencies were explored visually by looking at Nelson-Aalen estimators for the cumulative hazard and histograms of gap times. For events where the risk of an outcome event was not considered independent of the first occurrence, sensitivity analyses were undertaken which only included the first outcome event observed.  Sensitivity analyses assessing each vaccine independently, excluding co-administered vaccines from the analysis, were also undertaken. 

The relative incidence and 95\% CIs for each outcome were estimated using Poisson regression with length of windows included as offset terms. All analyses were conducted using R 3.5.1 \citep{rmanual} and the gnm package version 1.1-0 \citep{rgnm}.

\subsection{Ethical approval}

This MedicineInsight program was approved through the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners National Research and Evaluation Ethics Committee (NREEC) in December 2017 (NREEC 17-017). Approval for use of MedicineInsight data in this study was received from the NPS MedicineWise external Data Governance Committee on 23 November 2016 and an amended version on 29 September 2017.This study was also approved by the Sydney Children’s Hospitals Network Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC/17/SCHN/159). 

\section{Results}

\subsection{Descriptive analyses}

A total of 337,294 vaccination records for 150,756 individuals from 456 MedicineInsight sites were identified. After excluding individuals with multiple ZVL or 23vPPV vaccinations, and excluding multiple influenza vaccinations within 126 days of each other, a total of 332,988 vaccinations (ZVL: 92,857, 23vPPV: 21,480, and influenza: 218,651) for 150,054 individuals remained for inclusion in the analysis. The majority of individuals (x\%) were deemed to be under observation for the entire study period.

ZVL vaccinations occurred more commonly at the beginning of the study period following its addition to the NIP. Expected weekly cycles and seasonal fluctuations in vaccination counts were observed amongst the three vaccines investigated (\autoref{fig:vax_dates}). In general, the number of vaccination records declined with age with ZVL increasing slightly at 79 years of age (\autoref{fig:vax_ages}). ZVL was commonly co-administered influenza vaccine (16\% of vaccinations) and sometimes with 23vPPV (2\%). 23vPPV and influenza vaccine were often co-administered (43\% of vaccinations).

Over 2 million clinical attendances were observed among exposed individuals during their observation periods. The next most commonly identified outcome event was any rash, with 12,309 events observed. The rarest outcome event identified was injection site reaction, with 177 events observed.

\subsection{Self-controlled case series analysis}

\subsubsection{Injection site reactions}

An increase in the relative incidence of injection site reactions was observed in the 7-day risk window following all three vaccines in the main analysis (ZVL RI = 77.4, 95\% CI [48.1, 124.6]; 23vPPV 65.0, [31.66, 133.6]; influenza 6.6, [3.4, 12.8]). This was consistent in sensitivity analyses excluding co-administered vaccines.

In main and sensitivity analyses, the incidence of ISR remained elevated in the 42-day post-risk period following ZVL (RI = 3.4, 95\% CI [1.8, 6.5] in main analysis). A 7-day partition of this period identified that incidence remained elevated 8to 14 days post-vaccination (RI = 16.2, 95\% CI [6.8, 38.7]) before returning to baseline levels.

\subsubsection{Stroke}

\section{Discussion}

The results of this SCCS analysis of MedicineInsight GP data provide evidence to support the safety of ZVL in individuals aged 70–79 years. An expected increased incidence of ISR up to at least 7 days following vaccination was observed following all three vaccines. In the SPS safety sub study, ISR were more common in vaccine (48\%) compared to placebo (16\%) recipients \citep{simberkoff2010}. The intensity of erythema and swelling were significantly greater in vaccine recipients and persisted for longer, although fewer than 1\% of vaccine recipients reported them as severe. A post-marketing study of 193,083 adults aged over 50 years in eight US managed care organisations demonstrated a small but significant increased risk of cellulitis and infection one to seven days following vaccination using the case-centred method \citep{tseng2012}. In our study, we observed elevated incidence if ISR up to 14 days following ZVL. While the SPS sub study did demonstrate ISR significantly later in vaccine recipients compared to placebo recipients, events still occurred a median of 2.3 days following vaccination. Similarly, in global passive surveillance, ISR have been reported at a median of 2 days following vaccination \citep{willis2017herpes}. In this SCCS, the risk of ISR was also elevated in the sensitivity analysis that excluded concomitantly administered vaccines. Similarly, a clinical trial of ZVL administered concomitantly with influenza vaccine, ISR and systemic reactions were comparable in those administered the vaccines concomitantly versus ZVL alone \citep{levin2018immunogenicity}.

The use of general practice data and the SCCS design is a critical step in moving beyond passive surveillance and its inherent limitations. In Australia, many patients, especially older patients, see a regular general practitioner and GPs are immunisation providers for most patient cohorts. There is significant scope to better utilise routinely collected GP data for vaccine safety surveillance once the limitations and applications are more fully understood and validation of methodology has occurred. Linkage with hospitalisation data in Australia will make primary care data a rich source of information.

Observability of some events following vaccination within the MedicineInsight data depends on interaction between general practice site systems and hospital information.

\section{Conclusion}

No new safety concerns were identified for ZVL in this study based on a novel data source using an SCCS design. Expected findings in relation to the positive (ISR) and negative (burn) control conditions support the validity of the SCCS analysis in this setting using general practice data. Findings in relation to cardiovascular disease and stroke were reassuring. Further work should focus on validation of identified exposures and outcomes and linkage with hospitalisation data and within sites.
